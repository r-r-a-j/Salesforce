<!--
 *	DESCRIP		:	A design attribute is the parameter that is exposed in App Builder. 
 *					For each design attribute, there must be a corresponding aura attribute in the component with the exact same name as the design attribute. 
 *					Design parameters that youâ€™re exposing can be either a text input field or a picklist.
 * 					Parameters that should be a picklist include a datasource attribute with a comma-separated list of options, 
 *					as you can see in the <design:attribute name="searchCriteria">.
